            <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

                <h3>Where are you from?</h3>

                    <p><i>I was born in San Francisco, California in 
1993 and since then I've spent most of my life living in the East Bay 
(Oakland, Newark, San Leandro)</i>.</p>

                <h3>Why did you choose design?</h3>

                    <p><i>To put it simply, in senior year of high 
school I was introduced to Photoshop and InDesign. And once I knew about
 them, I didn't want to stop using them.</i></p>

                <h3>What do you plan to accomplish with design?</h3>

                    <p><i>The answer changes depending on when you ask me. But for the most part, I want to use design to tell stories.</i></p>

                <h3>What are your interests outside of design?</h3>

                    <p><i>I like to listen to music and play video games
 (Zelda fan here). I love watching Korean and Japanese dramas, anime, 
telenovelas, documentaries and basically pretty much anything.</i></p>
